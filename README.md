# Pratical-Project
Bootstrap and C# website project created with the help of 6 other people intended to be used by a great organization called Flowerpod. It is an AAC Guide Creation website that is currently being implemented.

# Reason for no code
As this is a project that is being implemented and was built speficially for this organization we will not be sharing the source files. We do however have our report on the application and a demo video at https://youtu.be/0Wwq-DDzjIw
